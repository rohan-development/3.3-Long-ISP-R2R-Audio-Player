The purpose of this ISP, the 8-Bit Audio Player is to play rotary-encoder-selectable-by-name 8-bit, 16 KHz, mono wav files using an R/2R digital to analog converter in place of a traditional I2C or SPI DAC.

The attached code files allow 2 ATmega328Ps to be used in tandem to control a TFT panel, as well as the R2R DAC.

See attached Report.pdf for further details.
